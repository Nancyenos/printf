## Background Context
   Write your own printf function.



## man or help:
   printf (3) [man 3 printf]

## Prototype: 
   int _printf(const char *format, ...);

   Requirements
   General
   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the
   options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
   All your files should end with a new line
   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
   Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl
   and betty-doc.pl
   You are not allowed to use global variables
   No more than 5 functions per file
   In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can
   use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo
   (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files
   at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the
   examples
   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file
   called main.h
   Don’t forget to push your header file
   All your header files should be include guarded
   Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
